# Authenticate Me - Frontend

This is part two of a two-part project. In the first part, you should have
implemented the entire Express + Sequelize backend with user authentication
routes. In this part, you will add a React frontend that uses your backend API
routes to login, signup, and logout a user. You will learn how to add a React
frontend to your Express application.

## Set Up

Create a folder called `frontend` at the very root of the application. It should
be at the same level as the `backend` folder.

Your file structure should now look like this:

```plaintext
authenticate-me
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── .gitignore
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

`cd` into the `frontend` folder.
